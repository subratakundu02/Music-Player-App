🎧 Get Pumped with Preloaded Tracks for Your Chilled Workout 🎧

Elevate your workout routine with this dynamic music player, preloaded with an enticing selection of songs meticulously curated for your chilled workout sessions.

The music app has a catchy UI🌶 to play music stored in the "music folder" using the HTML5 audio API💥. Check it in action <a href="https://joydeepmallick.github.io/Rotating_Disk_Music_Player/">👉🏼here👈🏼</a>

We have preferred to used **JSON** for storing of song info and might migrate to SQL in future as per need, ***JSON can be considered a lightweight database*** with less functionalities but can be considered a good start.
